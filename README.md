If the program isn't installed on the HERO controller, run Visual Studio 2017 with the project while the HERO is plugged in via
micro-usb.  Right click HeroArcadeDriveEx(with the C# icon) and in .NET Micro Framework click the dropdown and select the only option that isnt "none".  Then click run and the project is placed onto the HERO.  After it is done it should run automatically on powerup.
